## Doing


## Done

- Fix center article height and size
    > At the moment, they are smaller than the side articles. This looks strangeq
- Get categories implmented
- Need unified method for calling the api
    > It should not be done in the stores
- Put domains into configs
- When visting a category without articles, show a fallback page
- Update interfaces to reflect what comes from the api
- Switch nav bar to use new typeface
    > https://www.cdnfonts.com/lt-afficher-neue.font <- this typeface has more font-wights and options. Should be better for smaller screens and the logo
- BUG: When visiting a specific article, refreshing the page removes the article from state.
    * [ ] Add requeest to store
    * [ ] If article is not defined request the specific article
