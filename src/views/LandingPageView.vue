        <h2>Sneak Peek</h2>
        <p><em><strong>We’re starting small, and transparent.</strong></em></p>
        <p>Below is an early demonstration of how our AI reduces emotional tone in articles to focus purely on the
          facts.</p>
        <p>Our goal? A quieter news experience grounded in balance, not buzz.</p>

        <p><em>Why the variation?</em></p>
        <p>
          We calibrate our sentiment targets based on <strong>category norms</strong>. Tech can support more enthusiasm;
          world and politics need more neutrality.

        </p>

          ensuring fairness and balance.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You'll have access to full length articles that are transparent, balanced, and

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: How is this different from Ground News?</strong><br />
          <strong>A:</strong> Ground News shows bias across outlets, but it still leaves you sifting through dozens of
          articles. It’s
          overwhelming. Our approach writes a single balanced article per event so you don’t have to compare headlines,
          you just
          get the clearest version. One article. No clutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: How do you ensure balance?</strong><br />
          A: We use a combination of AI validations, source diversity, and human review/editing if needed. We model our
          processes after globally recognized media fairness guidelines
          to maintain consistent editorial standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: Who curates the content?</strong><br />
          A: AI scans and writes unique articles for each event, but every article is reviewed at every stage for
          balance,
          factual content, social score, etc. We aim to replicate real world publication pipelines, modeled on
          established
          editorial workflows. Lots of validation and retries.
