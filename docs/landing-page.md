## FAQs

**Q: How is this different from Ground News?**
**A:** Ground News shows bias across outlets, but it still leaves you sifting through dozens of articles. It’s overwhelming. Our approach writes a single balanced article per event so you don’t have to compare headlines, you just get the clearest version. One article. No clutter.

**Q: How do you ensure balance?**
A: We use a combination of AI validations, source diversity, and human review/editing if needed. We model our processes after [globally recognized media fairness guidelines](/static-content/media-fairness-guidelines) to maintain consistent editorial standards.

**Q: Who curates the content?**
A: AI scans and write unique articles for each event, but every article is reviewed at every stage for balance, factual content, social score, etc. We aim to replicate real world publication pipelines, modeled on established editorial workflows. Lots of validation and retries.

**Q: When will the app be available?**
A: We’re in closed alpha. Sign up to be the first to know when we launch publicly.

**Q: What happens to my data?**
A: We will store the absolute minimum to keep the app functional. We respect your privacy and never sell your data.
