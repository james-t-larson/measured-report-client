# Editorial Pipeline: From Story Lead to Publication

**Introduction:** In a traditional newspaper like *The New York Times*, producing a feature or enterprise story involves a meticulous multi-step process. A single article passes through many hands – from researchers and reporters to multiple editors, fact-checkers, and designers – before it reaches readers ([Expanding credit for journalists: looking beyond the byline – RJI](https://rjionline.org/news/expanding-credit-for-journalists-looking-beyond-the-byline/#:~:text=Most%20news%20stories%20pass%20through,checkers%2C%20to%20name%20a%20few)). Each role has specific responsibilities at different stages to ensure the story’s accuracy, quality, and integrity. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of this editorial pipeline, from the moment a story lead is identified to the point of editor approval and publication.

---

## Step 1: Story Lead Identification and Pitch  
A news story often begins with a potential **story lead** identified by a journalist or a dedicated **news researcher**. This could come from anywhere: a tip from a source, an observed trend, public records, or audience feedback. The researcher or reporter refines the idea into a **pitch**, outlining what the story might cover and why it matters. They then present this pitch to editors, usually at a section meeting or in a planning email. **Editors (Assignment/Section Editors)** evaluate each proposed idea against key criteria like timeliness, newsworthiness, novelty, and relevance ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=Stories%20typically%20begin%20in%20the,timeliness%2C%20newsworthiness%2C%20novelty%20and%20relevance)). For example, an idea that is unique and important to the community, and not already widely reported, will attract an editor’s interest. If the story idea meets these standards and aligns with the publication’s focus, the editors **greenlight the pitch** for development ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=Stories%20typically%20begin%20in%20the,timeliness%2C%20newsworthiness%2C%20novelty%20and%20relevance)) ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=After%20a%20pitch%20is%20greenlit%2C,the%20topic%20and%20potential%20sources)). (If not, the idea may be refined further or tabled for the future.) At this stage, the editor may also decide which desk or section the story belongs to (e.g. Metro, Business, Culture), guiding its trajectory.

---

## Step 2: Commissioning and Assignment  
Once a pitch is approved, the story enters the **commissioning phase**. An assignment editor (such as the section editor who covers the story’s topic) formally **assigns the story to a reporter** ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=After%20a%20pitch%20is%20greenlit%2C,the%20topic%20and%20potential%20sources)). Often, this is the reporter who pitched the idea or a staff writer with relevant expertise. The **editor’s role** here is to set the story up for success: they clarify the angle or focus, share any background information they have, and may suggest key sources or documents to pursue ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=After%20a%20pitch%20is%20greenlit%2C,the%20topic%20and%20potential%20sources)). For instance, the editor might provide the reporter with leads like, “Check the city council archives for past studies,” or “You might want to talk to our legal expert about this.” They also establish expectations such as the **scope** of the piece (length, depth), and a **deadline**. The reporter and editor together might sketch a preliminary plan for the reporting. At larger papers, this phase can involve a **planning meeting** with other teams – e.g. a photo editor might be looped in early to plan for photographs, or a data journalist might be assigned if the story involves analyzing datasets. By the end of this step, the reporter knows what is expected and has a roadmap for the reporting process.

---

## Step 3: In-Depth Research and Reporting  
With the assignment in hand, the **reporter** begins the core **reporting phase**. This involves all fact-gathering activities (which, while crucial, are not detailed here as per the focus). The reporter will conduct interviews, observe events, gather public records, and dig into research to unearth all relevant facts. For a feature or enterprise story, this phase is typically extensive – the journalist seeks out multiple perspectives and credible evidence to build a rich, informative piece ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=Reporters%20then%20begin%20the%20process,the%20complexity%20of%20a%20topic)). They might collaborate with **news researchers or librarians** to find archival information, or with a **data research team** for any statistical analysis. During this stage, the reporter keeps thorough notes and recordings and stays in regular contact with the assigning editor, especially if new developments alter the story’s direction. Importantly, **accuracy checks begin here**: a conscientious reporter double-checks critical facts as they gather them ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=Reporters%20then%20begin%20the%20process,the%20complexity%20of%20a%20topic)). For example, they verify spellings of names, confirm dates and figures from documents, and may even run certain claims by multiple sources. By the end of the reporting phase, the journalist has a wealth of information and is confident in its accuracy and completeness. They will often organize the material (perhaps transcribing interviews, highlighting key quotes or data) in preparation for writing.

---

## Step 4: Writing the First Draft  
At this point, the reporter transitions into **writing**. Using the reported material, the **journalist** crafts a narrative, often starting with an outline of how the story will unfold (e.g. a compelling lead, a logical structure for context and findings, and an ending that ties it together). Writing a non-breaking feature can take days or weeks, as it often involves weaving together complex information into a cohesive story. The reporter works to ensure the piece is engaging and clear while remaining truthful to the facts. They will typically write one or more **drafts** of the article, refining their language and flow. During this process, the reporter may seek interim feedback from their editor – for instance, they might run a rough outline or a first few paragraphs by the editor to confirm the tone and approach are on target. The assigned editor stands by to provide guidance, answer questions, or suggest adjustments (for example, “Let’s emphasize this aspect more and save that detail for later in the story.”) ([A Look Inside The New Yorker's Editorial Process: From Pitch to Publication - Ask.com](https://www.ask.com/lifestyle/look-inside-new-yorker-s-editorial-process-pitch-publication#:~:text=Once%20an%20idea%20has%20been,feedback%20and%20suggestions%20for%20improvement)). Once the reporter completes the first full draft, they review it themselves for any obvious issues, ensuring all quotes are correctly attributed and all facts included have supporting evidence on file. Now the draft is ready to hand over for editorial scrutiny.

---

## Step 5: First Editorial Review (Content Editing)  
 ([File:El Mercurio newsroom (6098651486).jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:El_Mercurio_newsroom_(6098651486).jpg)) *An open newsroom where editors and reporters collaborate on stories. In the content editing stage, editors work closely with reporters to refine the article’s structure and substance.*  
The first major edit is handled by the story’s **section editor or line editor** – often called the *handling editor*. This is a **content edit** focusing on the big picture and clarity of the piece. The editor reads the draft closely and evaluates elements such as the storytelling, structure, clarity, and completeness. At this stage, the editor’s responsibilities include: ensuring the article has a strong lead and logical flow, checking that the **central theme** is clear, and verifying that all necessary questions a reader might have are answered. They will also flag any areas that need more explanation or evidence. For example, the editor might note, “This section about the budget cuts could use a human example to illustrate the impact,” or “We need more context here about why this issue matters now.” The editor and reporter then **collaborate on revisions**. The reporter may need to do additional reporting (e.g. call back a source for clarification) or simply rewrite certain sections for better coherence. This back-and-forth can go through multiple rounds until both the editor and reporter are satisfied that the story is accurate, well-organized, and compelling. In a traditional newsroom, a story may pass through **several layers of editors** for content: for instance, after the initial section editor’s edits, a senior editor or deputy editor might review the piece as a second pair of eyes, further refining language or focus. Indeed, at The Brown and White (a newspaper example), an article might be reviewed by four ranks of editors in succession ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=The%20completed%20story%20then%20goes,be%20engaging%20to%20our%20audience)) – similarly, at the *NYT*, a feature could be read by the section editor, then a deputy editor, and sometimes even a managing editor depending on its prominence. Throughout these edits, factual content is also scrutinized: editors will **spot-check facts** that seem questionable and ensure claims are backed up by the reporting. The editorial staff “refines the narrative, fact-checks the content further and ensures the story will be engaging to the audience” ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=The%20completed%20story%20then%20goes,be%20engaging%20to%20our%20audience)). By the end of this content editing phase, the article’s structure and content are essentially final. The story has been shaped to fit the publication’s standards and style, and any major issues have been resolved through revision.

---

## Step 6: Dedicated Fact-Checking  
After the content is locked down, many news organizations implement a **fact-checking step** before moving on to final production. In this phase, a **fact-checker** or a research editor verifies every factual detail in the story one more time with an independent eye. In practice, once the handling editor declares the draft “final” in terms of storytelling, they hand it off to the publication’s fact-checking team ([The TiJ Fact Checking Guide - 2. Fact-Checking As Part of the Editorial Process](https://thetijproject.ca/guide/the-editorial-process#:~:text=Fact,checking%20department)). The reporter is often asked to assist by providing a **research package**: this includes an annotated version of the article where each statement or statistic is linked to its source, along with copies of documents, source contact information, and interview transcripts ([The TiJ Fact Checking Guide - 2. Fact-Checking As Part of the Editorial Process](https://thetijproject.ca/guide/the-editorial-process#:~:text=1,research%20package)). Armed with this, the **fact-checker’s responsibility** is to go through the story line by line and confirm each fact. They will contact sources directly if needed (for example, calling an interviewee to confirm that the quote and context are accurately represented) and cross-reference every claim with the evidence provided or external authoritative sources. Nothing is taken for granted – even “obvious” facts are double-checked to prevent any error from slipping through. This means if the story says a meeting occurred “on a Tuesday in June,” the fact-checker might verify the date on a calendar, or if a person’s title is mentioned, they confirm that title via the organization’s website. In the ideal workflow, **fact-checking is completed before copy editing and production** ([The TiJ Fact Checking Guide - 2. Fact-Checking As Part of the Editorial Process](https://thetijproject.ca/guide/the-editorial-process#:~:text=Fact,checking%20department)), so that any necessary corrections can be made without having to redo layouts. If the fact-checker finds a discrepancy or something that doesn’t line up, they communicate with the editor and reporter to resolve it – perhaps by adjusting the wording or by obtaining additional confirmation. This rigorous step acts as quality control on accuracy. Not all daily newspapers have a dedicated fact-checking department (often this duty falls to editors and reporters), but for in-depth features at high-tier publications, a formal fact-check is increasingly common. It helps uphold the paper’s credibility by ensuring that by publication time, **every detail can be trusted**.

---

## Step 7: Copy Editing and Proofreading  
Once content and facts are verified, the story moves to the **copy editing** stage. A **copy editor** (or a copyediting team) now reviews the article with a fine-tooth comb for grammar, style, and technical consistency. Their job is to ensure the writing is clean and conforms to the newspaper’s style guide (for example, The New York Times has its own stylebook for usage and formatting). They correct spelling errors, fix punctuation, and smooth out any awkward phrasing. Copy editors also enforce uniform usage of terms (e.g. ensuring a person’s name or a place is spelled consistently throughout, and according to official records). In addition to these language edits, copy editors serve as another layer of accuracy checking in practice. They often **double-check names, dates, and calculations** one more time as they edit, and flag anything that looks off ([Digging Into Fact-Checking - Professional Editors Network](https://pensite.org/2021/01/digging-into-fact-checking/#:~:text=Digging%20Into%20Fact,and%20may%20quickly%20look)). For instance, if the story states an official’s age or the population of a city, a diligent copy editor might quickly verify those against a reliable source. As one professional editor noted, copy editors act as “guardians of language, of accuracy” in the newsroom ([Digging Into Fact-Checking - Professional Editors Network](https://pensite.org/2021/01/digging-into-fact-checking/#:~:text=Digging%20Into%20Fact,and%20may%20quickly%20look)). This step may involve queries back to the reporter or primary editor if something is unclear – e.g., “The second paragraph references a ‘report’ – can we specify which report or add its date?” After the copy edit, the article is usually in its polished final text form. In many newsrooms, the copy editor (or a chief copy editor) will also write the **headline** and a short **deck/subheadline** at this stage, crafting a title that is catchy yet factual and conforms to space limits. The edited article may be printed out as a proof for one last read-through (proofreading) to catch any minor typos or formatting issues. By the end of copy editing and proofreading, the content is ready for publishing from a text standpoint – it is factually accurate, stylistically consistent, and free of errors.

---

## Step 8: Pre-Publication Review (Standards & Legal Checks)  
For sensitive stories or major enterprise pieces, an additional **pre-publication review** can take place. This involves specialized roles like a **standards editor** or the legal team. The **Standards Editor** (or ethics editor) ensures that the story adheres to the newspaper’s ethical guidelines and editorial standards. They review issues such as: Is the piece fair and balanced? Have we given anyone who is criticized a chance to respond? Are we using anonymous sources properly and only when necessary? Publications often have policies on such matters, and the standards editor’s job is to make sure the story complies. In some organizations, this person (or team) may be consulted during the editing process for advice, especially if the story involves potential ethical dilemmas. They provide **pre-publication advice** to journalists and editors to ensure content meets the outlet’s standards ([](https://newsombuds.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OSCE-REPORT.pdf#:~:text=pre,guidelines%20from%20time%20to%20time)). Meanwhile, if the article contains potentially defamatory material or legal sensitivities (for example, an investigation that accuses an individual or company of wrongdoing), the **legal department** will perform a libel review. A media lawyer will read the draft and check for any statements that could pose legal risks. They might suggest using more cautious language or adding attributive phrases (“according to...”) to protect against defamation claims. They also verify that all accusations are backed by solid evidence in case the newspaper needs to defend them. This legal check is crucial for investigative features – it can save the publication from lawsuits by pre-emptively addressing red flags. In this stage, changes might be made to the story not for style or content flow, but for **compliance and risk management** (e.g., removing an unnecessary detail that raises privacy concerns). If the story passes these standards and legal checks, it signals that the newspaper is confident in both its journalism and its defensibility. (In rare cases, a particularly thorny story might even be reviewed with the **ombudsman/public editor** for an external perspective, but typically the ombudsman stays out of pre-publication decisions to remain an independent post-publication watchdog.)

---

## Step 9: Final Editorial Approval and Scheduling  
Now the story has been reported, written, edited, fact-checked, copyedited, and legally vetted – it is essentially ready. The last step before publishing is getting the **final approval** from the top editorial ranks and scheduling the story for release. **Senior editors**—such as the Managing Editor, Editor-in-Chief, or a relevant **desk editor in charge** of that day’s edition—do a final read or are briefed on the piece. This is often a formality if all earlier steps were done diligently, but it’s an important sign-off especially for high-profile features. The top editors confirm that the story fits the publication’s overall direction and quality expectations. They also decide **when and where to publish** it. For example, a big Sunday feature might be held for the weekend print edition, or an enterprise piece might be timed to coincide with a related news peg or event. At *The New York Times*, department heads might pitch their finished stories at a daily news meeting to get a slot on the next day’s front page or home page. After top editors agree the story is ready, it can be released online at an appropriate time (sometimes immediately, if there’s no reason to wait) ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=After%20top%20editors%20agree%20a,publish%20as%20soon%20as%20possible)). This is also when they lock in details like the headline (which may be tweaked for space in print or SEO online) and any accompanying elements (photos, graphics) are finalized. Essentially, the story gets the **green light to publish** from the highest authority in the newsroom. With that approval, the piece is queued for publication according to the newspaper’s workflow (placed on the page layout for print, or scheduled in the content management system for digital). Everyone involved is alerted that the story is slated to go live.

---

## Step 10: Layout, Design, and Production  
Before the story appears in print or on the website, the production team ensures it’s presented properly. For a **print newspaper**, the article is handed to **layout/design editors** who will arrange it on the page. They determine how the text flows into columns, where to put the photos, and how big the headline will be, based on the space available. They might create sidebars or pull-quotes for long features to break up the text. The design team works on “**layout of the paper**,” placing each story in the issue along with its headlines and images ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=During%20press%20nights%20on%20Mondays,Tuesday%20or%20Friday%20print%20issues)). The assigned page might go through a couple of draft layouts (also known as galley proofs) which editors and designers review to ensure captions are correct and nothing important got cut off. Alongside, the **photo editor and graphics department** provide the visual elements. Any photographs to accompany the story are cropped and positioned, and infographics or illustrations are inserted with captions. For example, a feature on a community might include portraits of interviewees, or an investigative piece might have a timeline graphic – these need to be ready and checked. In modern newsrooms, this is often a coordinated digital process using a content management system (CMS) that also handles web presentation. For the **digital publication**, a **web producer or online editor** will format the article in the CMS. They embed multimedia (photos, videos, interactive graphics) into the online version, add hyperlinks to relevant background material, and ensure the piece is mobile-friendly. They might also craft a slightly different headline for the web (to be more search-engine or click friendly) versus the print headline. During production, a final proofread can happen on the laid-out pages or the staging site online to catch last-minute errors. This stage is highly collaborative: editors, designers, and producers are all synchronizing to deliver a polished product. When everything — text and design — is set, the pages are sent to the printing presses for physical newspapers, while the digital content is saved in draft, awaiting the publication time.

---

## Step 11: Publication (Going Live)  
This is the moment all the work comes to fruition. **Publication day** arrives, and the story is released to the audience. If it’s a print edition, copies of the newspaper roll off the presses with the feature included; if digital, an editor or automated scheduler hits “Publish” in the CMS, making the article live on the website. Often, major enterprise stories are published on the website the night before or early morning of the print date to reach online readers first. The newspaper’s homepage is updated to showcase the story (sometimes with a prominent headline or banner if it’s a big one). Immediately upon publishing, the focus shifts to **distributing and promoting** the piece. Editors or an audience engagement team will share the article across social media platforms and perhaps via email newsletters ([Explaining how our newspaper operates - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/09/explaining-how-our-newspaper-operates/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20our%20editors%20will%20share,interact%20and%20offer%20their%20perspectives)). For example, *The New York Times* might tweet the story, post it on Facebook, and feature it in that morning’s Top Stories email. This alerts readers and drives traffic. The published story may also be accompanied by related content links or an “Inside The Story” sidebar online to give readers context on how the story was reported. Now, readers everywhere can access the article in print or online and see the finished work. The newsroom monitors the reception: **editors and reporters watch for reader comments, web analytics, and pickup by other media**. Internally, there’s often a brief sigh of relief and congratulations among the team that shepherded the story through the pipeline. By the time readers are reading the headline, the piece has undergone numerous revisions and checks to ensure it’s worthy of the newspaper’s standards.

---

## Step 12: Post-Publication: Corrections and Ombudsman Oversight  
Even after publishing, the process isn’t completely over. A hallmark of reputable news organizations is that they remain accountable for what they print. In the hours and days following publication, editors and reporters stay alert for any errors or feedback. If a mistake is discovered – perhaps a misspelling that slipped through or a factual error identified by a source or reader – the team acts to issue a **correction**. Most papers have a formal corrections policy, where even minor errors are promptly acknowledged in a corrections column or added footnote online. For more complex follow-ups, the editors may schedule an update or clarification to the story. This is where the role of an **ombudsman** (or *public editor*) comes into play. The ombudsman is an independent, reader’s representative who reviews the newsroom’s performance and addresses complaints. If readers raise concerns about the story’s fairness, balance, or accuracy, the ombudsman investigates those **public concerns and complaints** with the newsroom ([](https://newsombuds.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OSCE-REPORT.pdf#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20the%20real%20world,be%20effectively%20and%20robustly%20investigated)). They may speak to the journalists and editors involved, examine whether the reporting and editing followed the paper’s standards, and then write a public column about the issue. The purpose is to hold the newsroom accountable and explain decisions to the audience. For instance, if an enterprise story draws criticism for how it characterized someone, the public editor might analyze whether it was justified or a lapse in judgment. This post-publication review provides an opportunity for reflection and, if necessary, improvement of processes. In many cases, the mere knowledge that an ombudsman will be looking at contentious stories adds incentive for everyone to uphold high standards throughout the pipeline. In summary, once a feature story is published, the editorial pipeline concludes by **learning from the outcome**: any errors are corrected transparently and any lessons (good or bad) inform future journalism. The result is a continuous cycle of accountability, ensuring that the next story idea that enters the pipeline benefits from the rigor and lessons of the last.
